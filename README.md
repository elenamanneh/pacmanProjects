This repository containsimplementations for four key projects from the UC Berkeley's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course. Each project focuses on different aspects of AI, from search algorithms to multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and probabilistic tracking.

## Project 1: Search in Pacman

### Overview
This project involves implementing search algorithms to help Pacman navigate through mazes to reach specific locations and collect food efficiently. The project challenges students to apply concepts of Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A* Search in various Pacman scenarios.

### Key Features
- Implement and understand basic search algorithms.
- Apply search strategies to solve Pacman navigation problems.
- Design heuristics to improve search efficiency.

## Project 2: Multi-Agent Pacman

### Overview
In this project, Pacman is placed in a multi-agent environment where it must interact with both adversarial and cooperative agents. The focus is on implementing algorithms for adversarial search, including minimax and alpha-beta pruning, as well as designing evaluation functions.

### Key Features
- Understand and implement minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms.
- Develop evaluation functions for multi-agent environments.
- Implement strategies for both cooperative and adversarial agents.

## Project 3: Reinforcement Learning

### Overview
This project introduces reinforcement learning concepts and algorithms. Implementation involves Q-learning and value iteration to teach Pacman how to navigate mazes by learning from its environment.

### Key Features
- Implement Q-learning and value iteration algorithms.
- Understand the principles of reinforcement learning.
- Apply reinforcement learning techniques to train Pacman in various scenarios.

## Project 4: Ghostbusters - Probabilistic Tracking

### Overview
The final project focuses on probabilistic tracking and inference in a hidden Markov model context. The goal id to help Pacman locate and catch hidden ghosts by implementing algorithms for filtering, particle filtering, and exact inference.

### Key Features
- Implement algorithms for probabilistic tracking.
- Understand and apply hidden Markov models.
- Develop techniques for filtering, particle filtering, and exact inference.
