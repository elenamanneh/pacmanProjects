# Project 1: Search in Pacman

## Overview

This project is part of the UC Berkeley's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course. It focuses on implementing search algorithms to help Pacman navigate through mazes to reach specific locations and collect food efficiently. The project challenges students to apply concepts of Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A* Search in various Pacman scenarios.

## Key Features

- Implement and understand basic search algorithms.
- Apply search strategies to solve Pacman navigation problems.
- Design heuristics to improve search efficiency.
